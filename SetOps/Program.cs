Implement the set type which contains integers. Represent the set as a sequence of its 
elements. Implement as methods: inserting an element, removing an element, returning 
whether the set is empty, returning whether the set contains an element, returning a 
random element without removing it from the set, returning the largest element of the 
set (suggestion: store the largest entry and update it when the set changes), printing the 
set. A set can store every element only once.
